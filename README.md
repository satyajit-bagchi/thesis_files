# A Study on Positioning for Industrial Tools using Inertial Sensors

This repo uses previous work based on OpenShoe and implements a ZUPT aided Extended Kalman filter for estimating pose using Inertial Measurement Units.

The implementation beats the current state of the art in position tracking using only imus.
